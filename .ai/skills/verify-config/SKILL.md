# Verify Configuration Skill

Audits project documentation against actual codebase conventions and enforces hard requirements
(task execution protocol, subagent delegation, multi-assistant sync integrity, session management).

## Steps

### 1. Read current documentation
   - Read `CLAUDE.md`
   - Read `REASONIX.md` (if exists)
   - Read `DEEPSEEK.md` (if exists)
   - Read `.ai/reference/critical-rules.md`
   - Read `.ai/reference/task-execution.md`
   - Read `.ai/reference/session-management.md`
   - Read `.ai/reference/templates/session-handoff.md.txt`
   - Read `.ai/session-context.md`
   - Read `.ai/patterns/cqrs-patterns.md`
   - Read `.claude/settings.json`

### 2. Codebase pattern audit (existing)
   - Pick a representative domain from `{ApplicationName}.Domain.*` as the reference implementation
   - Read 2-3 command handlers (Create, Update, Delete)
   - Read 2-3 query handlers (GetById, GetList)
   - Read 2-3 Model records from `Models/`
   - Read 2-3 Response records
   - Check `Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`
   - For each documented convention, verify it matches actual code
   - Categorize: **Correct** / **Drift** / **Missing** / **Stale**

### 3. Hard requirement checks

#### 3a. Task execution protocol
   - `.ai/progress/` folder exists
   - `.ai/completed/` folder exists
   - `.ai/plans/` folder exists
   - `CLAUDE.md` Task Execution section explicitly says progress files are MANDATORY
   - `REASONIX.md` (if exists) Task Execution section explicitly says progress files are MANDATORY
   - `DEEPSEEK.md` (if exists) Task Execution section explicitly says progress files are MANDATORY
   - `.ai/reference/task-execution.md` is tool-agnostic (no `EnterPlanMode` / `mv` references)

#### 3b. Subagent delegation
   - `CLAUDE.md` has a HARD RULE subagent delegation section naming what the main conversation may/may not do
   - `REASONIX.md` (if exists) has the same HARD RULE section
   - `DEEPSEEK.md` (if exists) has the same HARD RULE section
   - Agent rosters in `CLAUDE.md`, `DEEPSEEK.md`, and `README.md` list every agent in `.ai/agents/` — no Model column; the tier lives in the agent's own frontmatter
   - `model:` frontmatter in `.ai/agents/*.md` is always a tier alias (`sonnet` or `haiku`) — never a concrete model name
   - Shared docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `REASONIX.md`, `DEEPSEEK.md`, `README.md`) hardcode no concrete DeepSeek model names — the per-slot mapping is defined only by `powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`

#### 3c. Multi-assistant sync integrity
   - `DEEPSEEK.md` (if exists) exists alongside `CLAUDE.md` and `REASONIX.md`
   - Sync is folder-level junctions (Windows) / symlinks (Unix) from `.ai/skills/` and `.ai/agents/` — there is no
     per-target file content (no thin wrappers, no full copies). All platforms read the identical files through
     the link; content drift between platforms is structurally impossible, so do not diff file contents across
     `.claude/`, `.github/`, `.reasonix/`, `.pi/` — verify the *links* instead:
   - `.claude/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, `.reasonix/skills/`, `.pi/skills/` are each a junction/symlink resolving to `.ai/skills/`
   - `.claude/agents/`, `.github/agents/`, `.reasonix/agents/`, `.pi/agents/` are each a junction/symlink resolving to `.ai/agents/`
   - `.pi/chains/` is a junction/symlink resolving to `.ai/chains/`
   - Agent files reached via any of these junctions have `runAs: subagent` (check the `.ai/agents/` source directly — it's the same file)
   - No broken junctions: every target above exists and is reachable (a missing or dangling link means `sync-skills.py` hasn't been run, not "drift")
   - `.gitignore` excludes all 9 junction target dirs (`.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.github/skills/`, `.github/agents/`, `.reasonix/skills/`, `.reasonix/agents/`, `.pi/skills/`, `.pi/agents/`, `.pi/chains/`) so they're never accidentally committed as real directories
   - `.claude/settings.json` has `./.reasonix` in `additionalDirectories`
   - `.claude/settings.json` has a `SessionStart` hook running `python .ai/scripts/sync-skills.py` — this is what bootstraps a fresh clone, since git cannot track junctions (`core.symlinks=false` is common on Windows) and a clean checkout has none of the 9 target dirs until something creates them
   - `.claude/settings.json` also has PostToolUse hooks that re-run `python .ai/scripts/sync-skills.py` / `sync-agents.py` on changes under `.ai/skills/**` and `.ai/agents/**` (self-heal on edit, not "sync content" — the link IS the content)
   - Copilot/Reasonix/pi have no session-start hook of their own; README's "run once after cloning" manual step is required for those tools even though Claude Code self-heals
   - `.claude/settings.json` has a DEEPSEEK.md sync hook triggering on `.ai/reference/critical-rules.md`, `.ai/reference/task-execution.md`, `.ai/agents/**`, and `CLAUDE.md` (currently absent — flag as **Missing**, not drift, since `DEEPSEEK.md` is hand-maintained and can go stale silently)
   - `.gitignore` includes `CLAUDE.md.deepseek-backup`

#### 3d. Session management
   - `.ai/reference/session-management.md` has generic `[assistant name]` Written By (not hardcoded to one assistant)
   - `.ai/reference/session-management.md` lists all assistants that share the session context
   - `.ai/reference/templates/session-handoff.md.txt` includes all assistants in the pick-lists
   - `.ai/session-context.md` has no stale `[Claude Code | GitHub Copilot]`-only references

#### 3e. DEEPSEEK.md content integrity
   - `DEEPSEEK.md` inlines the subagent delegation table (the same agent types as `CLAUDE.md`)
   - `DEEPSEEK.md` inlines the most critical coding rules as direct content (not cross-references to `.ai/reference/critical-rules.md`)
   - `DEEPSEEK.md` inlines the task execution protocol (plan → progress file → complete cycle)
   - `DEEPSEEK.md` is self-contained — a DeepSeek model can follow it without resolving nested file references
   - `DEEPSEEK.md` structure is flatter than `CLAUDE.md` (fewer levels of indirection, fewer cross-references)
   - `DEEPSEEK.md` is ~180-220 lines (concise enough for DeepSeek context but comprehensive)
   - `DEEPSEEK.md` references `.ai/` folder only as an appendix for deep dives, not as required reading
   - `DEEPSEEK.md` acknowledges it runs inside Claude Code's runtime (tools available: Agent, Skill, Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, EnterPlanMode, TaskCreate, etc.)

### 4. .ai/ folder structure
   - Verify `.claude/settings.json` has `plansDirectory` pointing to local `.ai/plans`
   - Verify `.ai/progress/` and `.ai/plans/` folders exist
   - Check that no project-specific config leaked to global `~/.claude/` or `~/.reasonix/`

### 5. Present findings
   - Show a summary table of all checks with their status
   - For each failure, show the specific gap and how to fix it
   - Categorize:
     - **Correct** — passes
     - **Missing** — required file/section doesn't exist
     - **Stale** — references wrong assistant names or model names
     - **Drift** — content contradicts the canonical pattern
   - Wait for user approval before making changes

### 6. Standards-compatibility surfaces (generated from evidence)
   - **Applicability first:** generate only when the working tree holds a generated solution — at least
     one `*.sln`. Where none exists (this template repository is one), report the step as a no-op and
     write nothing.
   - Read `.ai/reference/standards.md` and parse it by its own *How This File Is Parsed* contract: the
     status table is the one whose header row immediately follows `## Compatibility`, and `Standard` is
     the row key. Never select a table by its `Compatibility` column — the vocabulary table has one too.
   - Run each `Evidence` row's proving validator and capture its exit code. Report a result only for a
     validator that actually ran.
   - Compute each row's status: an `Evidence` row keeps `Evidence` only when its validator exits `0`,
     every path in its `Implementing artifact` cell exists, and at least one pattern in its `Evidence a
     project produces` cell matches something the project produced — substitute `*` for each `{…}` and
     glob it against the working tree, so `docs/slices/{BC}/{Entity}.{Operation}/test-plan.md` is
     tested as `docs/slices/*/*/test-plan.md`. Where a pattern matches nothing, the row is naming a
     file this project does not hold, and it renders one step lower — `Aligned` — with the cause in the
     generated `Note` column, naming what was not found. One step, never a fourth value, never a silent
     downgrade, and never a token the manifest does not carry for that row. The path and pattern tests
     belong to a generated solution, which is the same condition as the applicability bullet above —
     `.ai/tests/validate-standards.py` implements exactly these three causes, so a generator that
     disagrees with it is the divergence this step exists to avoid.
   - Regenerate both surfaces from their templates:
     - `COMPLIANCE.md` at the project root — the whole file, from `.ai/reference/templates/compliance.md.txt`
     - the `## Standards Compatibility` section in `README.md` — only the block between
       `<!-- BEGIN standards-status -->` and `<!-- END standards-status -->`, from
       `.ai/reference/templates/standards-section.md.txt`
   - Apply the marker rules exactly as `.ai/reference/templates/standards-section.md.txt` states them:
     - exactly one marker pair — unbalanced, duplicated or interleaved markers (`END` before its `BEGIN`)
       **stop generation** and report the line numbers; resolve by hand, never guess
     - markers absent — append the generated block at the end of `README.md`, markers included, and
       report where it was placed
     - everything outside the markers is left byte-identical
     - the provenance line sits inside the block, directly above the closing marker — exactly one, in
       the manifest's rule-8 shape
     - no badge, shield, logo or image
   - Show the proposed diff for both surfaces and **wait for approval** before writing — step 5's
     contract governs here too; this step is never a silent mutator.
   - After writing, `python .ai/tests/validate-standards.py` must pass; a recorded validator exit code
     that disagrees with a re-run fails the check.
