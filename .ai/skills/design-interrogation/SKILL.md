name: design-interrogation
description: >
  Structured design interrogation — interview the user relentlessly about a plan,
  architecture, or technical decision until every branch of the decision tree is
  resolved. Consumes product-discovery output when available. Use whenever a user says "grill me", "stress-test my plan", "poke holes
  in this", "challenge my design", "interview me about this design", or wants a
  rigorous review of any design, architecture, or technical proposal — even if they
  don't use these exact words. Use when a plan, architecture, or technical decision needs pressure-testing before you commit to it. When in doubt, trigger this skill.

# Design Interrogation

Relentless, structured interrogation of a plan or design. Walk every branch of the
decision tree, resolve dependencies between decisions one-by-one, and reach a shared
understanding before closing.

## Upstream: product-discovery

This skill consumes the output of [`product-discovery`](../product-discovery/SKILL.md) when available.
If the user ran `product-discovery` first, Phase -1 recognises `docs/product/*` files and imports
all pre-resolved decisions (`PD-nnn` entries from `discovery-decisions.md`) with a **Source** column
in `session-decisions.md`, so interrogation focuses only on the remaining technical dimensions.
When discovery did NOT run, Phase -1 offers a short capture pass for A1, A2, and A5 based on
existing documents to draft Product Specification sections 1–3, then proceeds to full interrogation.

---

## What This Skill Does

- **Interviews** the user on every aspect of their plan, one focused question at a time
- **Maps** the decision tree, tracking which branches are resolved, deferred, or blocked
- **Recommends** a concrete answer with reasoning for each question asked
- **Explores** the codebase to answer questions that can be resolved without user input
- **Summarizes** all decisions and open items when interrogation is complete

---

## Interrogation Protocol

### Session Start — Load Required Skills

Before asking the first question, load these three skills. They are active throughout the
entire session — not just at the end:

| Skill | Load | Role During Session |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| [`ubiquitous-language`](../ubiquitous-language/SKILL.md) | **Required — load first** | Captures domain terms as they emerge; draft written to `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` immediately |
| [`usecase-specification`](../usecase-specification/SKILL.md) | **Required — load second** | Drafts use cases as flows resolve; each bounded context gets a draft file |
| [`user-story`](../user-story/SKILL.md) | **Required — load third** | Drafts stories as acceptance criteria are agreed; finalized with Gherkin at session end |

Then create the decision log (see **Progressive Document Capture** below) and start Phase -1.

---

### Phase -1: Document Intake

#### Session Start: Check for interrupted session first

On start, detect if `docs/session-decisions.md` exists. If it does:

> I found an earlier session. Would you like to **resume** it, **amend** (change some decisions), or **start over**?

- **Resume**: reload decisions from the earlier session and continue with open items
- **Amend**: show which decisions to revise, replay those branches
- **Start over**: begin fresh (archive the earlier file)

#### Check for product-discovery output

If the user ran [`product-discovery`](../product-discovery/SKILL.md) first, `docs/product/` will
contain `product-brief.md`, `audience-profile.md`, `ux-brief.md`, `ui-design-brief.md`, 
`platform-deliverables.md`, and `discovery-decisions.md`. When present:

1. Read all files in `docs/product/` — do NOT ask questions already answered there
2. Import each `PD-nnn` decision from `discovery-decisions.md` to `session-decisions.md` as **Pre-Resolved**,
   with a **Source** column showing `docs/product/discovery-decisions.md`
3. Pre-resolve Phase 0: **A1** (product type from discovery), **A2** (scope from product-brief), **A5** (surfaces from platform-deliverables)
4. Pre-fill **A4** (Hard Constraints) from discovery Phase 13/14 constraints and the codebase, but **ask for confirmation**
5. **Always ask A3** (Architecture Shape) — discovery does not resolve this
6. Flag any `[TECH-OPEN]` items in discovery decisions as open questions for the matching dimension
7. Proceed directly to Phase 0 (A3 + confirmed A4) with the product context loaded

#### Otherwise: Check for other existing documents

> Before we start: do you have any existing documents I should read first?
> (business case, PRD, architecture spec, migration plan, functional design)
> If so, share them — I'll save them to `docs/input/` and extract what's already decided.
>
> **Note:** Input files may hold customer data or commercial secrets. I'll confirm the repository
> is private before saving; if you'd like to keep them out of version control, I can add
> `docs/input/` to `.gitignore`.

If documents are provided:
1. Save them to `docs/input/` (e.g. `docs/input/business-case.md`) and confirm repository visibility
2. Read and analyze them — identify any bounded contexts already named
3. Extract all decisions already made — log to `session-decisions.md` as **Pre-Resolved** with Source noted
4. Run extractions **in parallel** using the skills below:
   - If BCs already identifiable → spawn one extractor per BC
   - If BCs not yet known → run both skills in parallel
   - → [`usecase-specification/SKILL.md` — Mode 0](../usecase-specification/SKILL.md) for use cases
   - → [`user-story/SKILL.md` — Mode 0](../user-story/SKILL.md) for user stories
5. Announce: "Extracted [N] use cases and [M] user stories — [X] gaps marked [OPEN]."
6. Proceed to Phase 0

If no documents and no earlier session → proceed directly to Phase 0.

---

### Phase 0: Strategic Anchor

Before starting depth-first interrogation, establish the business context and architecture shape.
If product-discovery ran, A1, A2, and A5 are pre-resolved; otherwise ask all five (A1–A5).
Always ask A3 and confirm A4 regardless of discovery history.

**When discovery ran:** Present A3 + confirmed A4 only. When discovery did NOT run:
present all five at once, clearly numbered A1–A5:

---

**A1 — Business Case** *(Pre-resolved if discovery ran)*

Is this greenfield (new system), migration (replacing an existing system), or
an extension of an existing system?

**My recommendation:** [infer from context; or from discovery product-type]

---

**A2 — Purpose & Scope** *(Pre-resolved if discovery ran)*

What are we building and what is explicitly out of scope?

**My recommendation:** [scoped interpretation; or from discovery product-brief]

---

**A3 — Architecture Shape** *(Always ask)*

Event-driven with event sourcing, event-driven with state-based persistence,
or direct request/response?

**My recommendation:** [based on domain complexity and existing stack]

---

**A4 — Hard Constraints** *(Confirm if pre-filled; ask if no discovery)*

What is non-negotiable? (team size, deadline, existing stack, compliance,
cloud vs. on-premise)

**My recommendation:** [from discovery Phase 13/14 if available; else infer from codebase
— check `Directory.Packages.props` and Aspire AppHost for existing choices]

---

**A5 — Surfaces & Deliverables** *(Pre-resolved if discovery ran)*

What are the target platforms and surfaces? (web, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, API, etc.)

**My recommendation:** [from `platform-deliverables.md` if discovery ran; else
infer from the problem domain and audience]

---

After A1–A5 are answered or confirmed, if product-discovery ran, propose bounded context candidates derived from the MoSCoW capabilities, top journeys, and glossary from `discovery-decisions.md`. Ask:

> Based on the capabilities and journeys you described, I see these candidate bounded contexts: [names from discovery]. Do these match your mental model, or should we rename or split them?

Confirm the list before proceeding to Phase 1. This confirms the BC count and enables the Phase 1 parallel trigger.

Then adapt the interrogation order based on A1. See **Interrogation order** table below for the sequence per product type.

---

### Phase 1: Parallel BC Interrogation

When Phase 0 (A2) identifies 2 or more bounded contexts, spawn one sub-agent per BC
and run them in parallel. Each agent covers Dimensions 2–7 for its BC only. Dimension 8 (Migration & Rollout) is global and runs as a single-agent dimension after the domain block; then Dimensions 9–15 follow in dependency order.

**Trigger:**
```
BCs identified in A2 ≥ 2?
  YES → Spawn N BC agents in parallel (one per BC)
  NO  → Continue single-agent depth-first from Phase 0
```

**Per-BC dimensions (Dimensions 2–7):**

| Dimension | BC-specific questions |
|-----------|----------------------|
| 2 — Domain Model | Aggregates, entities, value objects for this BC |
| 3 — BC Internals | Scope boundary — what is inside this BC? |
| 4 — Data Flow | Commands, queries, events flowing through this BC |
| 5 — Integration Points | Which external systems does this BC touch? |
| 6 — Failure Modes | What happens when this BC's core component fails? |

Each BC agent writes immediately to:
- `session-decisions.md` — its own BC section
- `docs/bounded-contexts/{Domain}/use-cases.md` — draft use cases as flows resolve
- `docs/bounded-contexts/{Domain}/user-stories.md` — draft stories as criteria are agreed
- Follows the depth-first rule within its own BC

**Coordination agent** (main session) batches one open question per BC per round:

```
**BC: OrderManagement — Question 1 — Domain Model**
[question + recommendation]

**BC: Inventory — Question 1 — Domain Model**
[question + recommendation]
```

**After all BC agents complete:**
1. Cross-BC integration questions (how do BCs communicate?)
2. Dimension 8 — Migration & Rollout (global, single agent)
3. Dimensions 9–15 in dependency order (see **Interrogation order** table)

---

### Question Format

Ask one question at a time. Each question must be specific, answerable, and accompanied
by a concrete recommendation. Use this format:

---

**Question N — [Topic]**

[The question, clearly stated.]

**My recommendation:** [Your concrete recommendation and the reasoning behind it.]

---

Do not list multiple questions at once. Depth-first: fully resolve one branch before
moving to the next sibling.

### Decision Dimensions

Cover these areas in dependency order — skip dimensions that are clearly irrelevant
or already resolved. Dimensions 1–8 are ordered for backend/domain work; Dimensions 9–15
cover client surfaces, operations, and quality gates (see **Interrogation order** table below).

| # | Dimension | Key Questions |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Purpose & Scope** | What is being built? What is explicitly out of scope? |
| 2 | **Domain Model** | What are the aggregates, entities, and value objects? |
| 3 | **Bounded Contexts** | Where are domain boundaries? How do contexts communicate? |
| 4 | **Data Flow** | How do commands, queries, and events move through the system? |
| 5 | **Integration Points** | What external systems, APIs, or services are involved? |
| 6 | **Failure Modes** | What happens when each component fails? |
| 7 | **Non-Functionals** | Which quality attributes must this solution meet? — question set below |
| 8 | **Migration & Rollout** | How is this deployed? What is the rollout strategy? |
| 9 | **Client Surfaces & UX Architecture** | Per surface from A5: render/host model (Blazor Server/WASM/Auto/Hybrid/MAUI/WinUI/WPF), shared UI library vs per-platform, navigation & state management, design-system/tokens implementation, theming (light/dark/high-contrast), responsive & adaptive rules, offline & sync conflict policy, device-API access, localisation mechanism, accessibility implementation & test approach, form-factor handling. **Prototype fidelity:** token source of truth, component mapping, visual-regression baseline from mockups, design review gate |
| 10 | **Identity, Access & Tenancy** | Identity provider, flows per surface, roles & permissions, tenancy model & isolation, session/token lifetime per platform, admin/impersonation, API client auth |
| 11 | **Data Management & Privacy** | Stores per bounded context, retention & deletion, PII inventory & classification, consent, backup/restore & RPO/RTO, import/migration, export/portability, data residency |
| 12 | **Delivery, Environments & Hosting** | Environments, CI/CD, branching & versioning, hosting/cloud & cost envelope, store/installer/updater pipelines, feature flags, rollback, signing & secrets. **Sizing:** end this dimension by asking: *"What is the T-shirt size (XS/S/M/L/XL) for each capability? Does this fit your budget and deadline?"* Log the answer and compare scope vs budget in the Product Specification. |
| 13 | **Observability & Operations** | Structured logging, metrics, tracing, alerting thresholds, product analytics tracking plan & consent, crash reporting for native clients, support workflow, runbooks, SLA/SLO |
| 14 | **Testing Strategy** | Test pyramid per BC, BDD scope, E2E & accessibility & visual regression (against the mockups), device/browser/OS matrix, test data, performance tests, definition of done. **Sizing confirmation:** end by confirming the sizing question answers from Dimension 12 against the testing strategy — does the test pyramid fit the estimate and deadline? |
| 15 | **AI/ML Features** *(conditional)* | Asked only when discovery flags AI or the user mentions it: model/provider choice & swap-ability, prompt/data handling & privacy, evaluation & quality gates, human-in-the-loop, cost & rate limits, safety/abuse controls, transparency, EU AI Act classification |

### Interrogation order

Dimensions are resolved in dependency order (domain first; migration immediately after when A1=Migration; then quality first; identity and data before client surfaces; delivery, operations and testing last). The sequence below applies to **greenfield** and **extension** products. For **Migration**, Dimension 8 is pulled forward to immediately after the domain block (Dimensions 1–7).

| Position | Dimension | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | 1–7 (Domain + Quality) | Core design decisions; shape all downstream choices |
| 2 | 8 (Migration & Rollout) *(greenfield/extension: moved here for migrations)* | If A1=Migration, immediately after domain; otherwise final dimension |
| 3 | 11 (Data Management) | Determine storage and retention before designing surfaces |
| 4 | 10 (Identity & Access) | Auth flow shapes client surface design |
| 5 | 9 (Client Surfaces) | Navigate by audience, tech stack, data decisions already made |
| 6 | 12 (Delivery & Hosting) | Constraints from hosting/CI/CD affect client and server choices |
| 7 | 13 (Observability) | Measurement plan (tracking) seeds from goals (GL-nnn) |
| 8 | 14 (Testing) | QA strategy last; scope set by all prior dimensions |
| 9 | 15 (AI/ML) | Conditional; only when flagged by discovery or the user |

**A1 branching — override this order when A1 ≠ Greenfield:**
- **Greenfield:** Use order above (1–7 → 11 → 10 → 9 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15); Dimension 8 is final
- **Migration:** Execute Dimension 8 immediately after Dimension 7 (right after domain block); then 11 → 10 → 9 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15
- **Extension:** Run codebase-first checks before Phase 0 (what already exists, what is pre-resolved); most decisions 2–7 are confirmed from existing code, not asked

### Dimension 7 — Quality Attribute Questions

Dimension 7 is where quality attributes **enter** the design — the reviewer only inspects them after
the fact. The vocabulary is ISO/IEC 25010:2023: the nine product quality characteristics and their
review questions are in `.ai/reference/quality-model.md`. Resolve these with the user in the standard
question format, one at a time, and ask only the ones the design implicates. An attribute that does
not apply is recorded as **not applicable** and is not turned into a question — most solutions resolve
three to five of the nine, and asking all nine as a matter of course turns a design conversation into
a questionnaire.

| # | Characteristic | What to resolve |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Functional suitability | Which stated business outcome has no use case yet, and which use case has no acceptance criterion behind it? |
| 2 | Performance efficiency | What is the expected load, and what is the slowest acceptable response for the heaviest operation — as a number, not as "fast"? |
| 3 | Compatibility | Which external systems must this exchange data with, in what shape (API version, file format, database dialect), and what must keep running unchanged alongside it? |
| 4 | Interaction capability | Who uses it, through which surface, and how do they find out what to do and recover from a mistake? *No human surface → not applicable.* **If product-discovery ran, this is pre-resolved from `ux-brief.md` / `audience-profile.md` — do not re-ask; log the finding as Pre-Resolved and move on.** |
| 5 | Reliability | Which failures are tolerable and which are not, and what happens to in-flight work when a dependency is down? Is running the same command twice safe? |
| 6 | Security | Who must not be able to do or see this, where does the trust boundary sit, and what data classification applies? |
| 7 | Maintainability | Which parts are expected to change fastest, and which bounded contexts must stay independently changeable? |
| 8 | Flexibility | What must be replaceable without a rewrite (database, identity provider, hosting model), and what must scale on its own? |
| 9 | Safety | Can a wrong answer or an outage here harm a person, a physical system, or data that cannot be recreated — and does the design fail safe? *Ask once; record the answer either way.* |

**Where the answers land.** Each resolved attribute is logged as a Dimension 7 row in
`session-decisions.md` and carried into the architecture document with the rest of the decisions.
Quality attributes are **not** numbered as acceptance criteria — `.ai/reference/traceability.md`
records that rule, and a criterion with no scenario behind it would be reported by the traceability
validator.

### Codebase Exploration

Before asking the user about something that can be determined from the codebase,
explore the codebase first. Announce what you found:

> I checked the codebase and found that X is already handled by Y — moving on.

Use the Read, Grep, and Glob tools to inspect relevant files. Do not ask the user
to confirm what the code already tells you.

### Decision Tree Tracking

Maintain a mental model of the decision tree during interrogation:

- **Open** — decision not yet reached
- **Resolved** — decision made, no open sub-questions
- **Deferred** — user consciously chose to decide later
- **Blocked** — cannot proceed without external information

When a decision opens new sub-questions (e.g., choosing an event-driven approach
raises questions about the event schema), explore those sub-questions before moving
to the next top-level topic.

---

## Progressive Document Capture

Do not wait until the end of the session to write output. Capture decisions, domain terms, use
cases, and user stories **as they emerge** — this ensures nothing is lost if the session is
interrupted, and makes the finalization step a completion pass rather than a cold generation from memory.

### Session Start — Create Decision Log

Before asking the first question, create the decision log file:

```
docs/session-decisions.md
```

Use this header. Include a **Source** column for decisions imported from `docs/product/`:

```markdown
# Session Decisions — {SolutionName}

> Live decision log. Updated after each resolved question. Finalized into the full architecture document at session end.

## Decisions

| # | Dimension | Decision | Rationale | Source |
|---|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|
```

When importing decisions from `docs/product/discovery-decisions.md`, populate the Source
column with the file path and decision ID (e.g., `docs/product/discovery-decisions.md — PD-015`).
When a decision meets a council trigger from `AGENTS.md`, flag it in the Rationale column:
`Council recommended — [trigger name]`.

### After Each Resolved Question

Immediately append to `session-decisions.md`:

```markdown
| {N} | {Dimension} | {chosen approach} | {brief rationale} | |
```

Announce:

> 📝 Logged to `session-decisions.md`.

### When a Domain Term Emerges

As soon as a term is used and agreed upon, append it to `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` (create the
file if it does not yet exist, mark it `[DRAFT]` in the title until the full ubiquitous-language
skill finalizes it):

```markdown
## [DRAFT] Ubiquitous Language — {SolutionName}

| Term | Definition | Bounded Context | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| {Term} | {Definition} | {Domain} | [DRAFT] |
```

### When a Use Case Becomes Clear

As soon as the main flow of a bounded context resolves, use `usecase-specification`
skill **Mode 1** to write the draft entry to
`docs/bounded-contexts/{BoundedContext}/use-cases.md`.

→ Follow the draft entry format defined in
  [`usecase-specification/SKILL.md` — Mode 1](../usecase-specification/SKILL.md).
  Do NOT use a custom format here.

### When User Stories Emerge

As soon as acceptance criteria for a feature are agreed, use `user-story`
skill **Mode 1** to write the draft entry to
`docs/bounded-contexts/{BoundedContext}/user-stories.md`.

→ Follow the draft entry format defined in
  [`user-story/SKILL.md` — Mode 1](../user-story/SKILL.md).
  Do NOT use a custom format here.

### Finalization: Complete the Session Deliverables

When interrogation is complete, finalization does not generate from scratch — it **completes and
finalizes** the drafts already written:

- Remove all `[DRAFT]` markers
- Fill gaps in use cases (alternate flows, Gherkin)
- Add Gherkin to user stories, validate INVEST
- Complete the architecture document from `session-decisions.md`

---

## Architecture Document

### Step 1: Load Relevant Instruction Files

Before writing the architecture document, load these instruction files to pre-fill constraints and check for compliance:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.ai/project/tech-stack.md` | Confirm technology choices, versions, and constraints |
| `.ai/reference/forbidden-tech.md` | Check that chosen libraries/patterns are not banned |
| `.ai/project/architecture.md` | Reference architecture patterns and ADR template |
| `.ai/reference/quality-model.md` | ISO/IEC 25010 vocabulary for Dimension 7 answers |
| `.ai/reference/standards.md` | Compliance requirements and validator rules |

Before asking any question, check the codebase for existing choices in `Directory.Packages.props`,
Aspire AppHost, and existing projects — pre-populate A4 constraints and A5 surfaces with what
you find.

### Step 2: Check for Violations

Scan the draft architecture document for these **FORBIDDEN patterns**:

| ❌ Forbidden | ✅ Replace With |
|-------------|----------------|
| SQL DDL (`CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`) | EF Core `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>` |
| Hardcoded connection strings | Aspire `.WithReference()` or environment variables |
| MediatR (`_mediator.Send()`, `services.AddMediatR()`) | Direct `ICommandHandler<T,R>` injection |
| `DateTime` (timezone-naive) | `DateTimeOffset` |
| Missing pattern rationale | Add ADR explaining why the pattern was chosen |

### Step 3: Document Pattern Rationale

For each major pattern, include a brief ADR explaining **why** this implementation was chosen.
Refer to `.ai/project/architecture.md` for the ADR template.

### Step 4: Finalize Session Deliverables (MANDATORY)

The three required skills were loaded at session start and have been capturing drafts throughout
the interrogation. This step **finalizes** those drafts and compiles the Product Specification — it is not a cold generation from memory.

| # | Deliverable | Skill | Output File | Action |
|---|-------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | **Ubiquitous Language Glossary** | [`ubiquitous-language`](../ubiquitous-language/SKILL.md) | `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` | Complete draft — remove `[DRAFT]`, resolve ambiguities, add missing terms |
| 2 | **Use Case Specifications** | [`usecase-specification`](../usecase-specification/SKILL.md) | `docs/bounded-contexts/{Domain}/use-cases.md` | Complete draft — fill alternate flows, add Gherkin for every flow |
| 3 | **User Stories** | [`user-story`](../user-story/SKILL.md) | `docs/bounded-contexts/{Domain}/user-stories.md` | Complete draft — add Gherkin, validate INVEST, ensure ≥3 criteria per story |
| 4 | **Product Specification** | None (compilation) | `docs/product/product-specification.md` | Compile from deliverables 1–3, session-decisions, architecture document, and `docs/product/*` files (if product-discovery ran) — see **Deliverable 4** subsection below |

#### Finalization Order

Execute in this sequence — each builds on the previous:

1. **Ubiquitous Language first** — finalize all draft terms; canonical vocabulary must be locked
   before use cases and stories are completed.

2. **Use Case Specifications second** — complete all draft use cases using finalized terminology.
   Add Gherkin for every main and alternate flow.

3. **User Stories third** — complete all draft stories using finalized terminology and use cases.
   Add Gherkin traced to every acceptance criterion. Validate INVEST.

4. **Product Specification last** — compile the consolidated what-we-build + technical requirements document; see subsection below for structure.

#### Announcements

For each deliverable, announce what is being finalized and confirm completion. For example:

> **Deliverable 1 of 4 — Ubiquitous Language**
> ✅ Complete — N terms defined.

> **Deliverable 4 of 4 — Product Specification**
> ✅ Complete — specification ready for handoff.

#### Skip Only With Explicit User Consent

If the user says "skip use cases" or "no stories needed", mark the deliverable as **Deferred**
and include it in the closing summary. Never skip without recording it there.

#### Deliverable 4 — Product Specification

The Product Specification is a consolidated index document — written after deliverables 1–3 are complete.
It joins what you are building (from product-discovery, if it ran) with the technical requirements (from this interrogation).

**Structure:** 11 sections — Vision/Problem/Audience → Scope/Release Plan → Experience/Journeys → Surfaces/Deliverables → Domain/Glossary → Technical Requirements → Compliance → Roadmap & Sizing → Traceability → Risks/Assumptions → Sign-Off

**Source map (per-section origin):**
- Sections 1–3 (What we build, Scope, Experience): from `product-brief.md`, `ux-brief.md`, `ui-design-brief.md`, prototype if discovery ran; else capture from A1, A2, A5 and goals (GL-nnn) + skip as [Deferred — run product-discovery]
- Section 4 (Surfaces & Deliverables): from `platform-deliverables.md` if discovery ran; else from A5 + interrogation answers
- Section 5 (Domain, Glossary): from deliverables 1–3 (UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md, use-cases.md, user-stories.md)
- Section 6 (Technical Requirements): from architecture document + Dimensions 9–15 decisions in `session-decisions.md`
- Sections 7–11: compiled from compliance answers, roadmap sizing, traceability coverage, risks/assumptions, sign-off
- Per-section source tables for sections 7–11 documenting which dimension/decision each requirement came from

**Rules:**
- Skip only with explicit consent; record as **Deferred** in closing summary
- All IDs traced verbatim: `SCR-001`, `UC-{BC}-001`, `US-{BC}-001`, `DLV-001`
- Hyperlink all sections to source documents where they exist

→ Copy and complete: [references/product-specification-template.md](references/product-specification-template.md)

**When discovery did NOT run:**
- Mark Sections 1–3 as [Deferred — run product-discovery], OR
- Run a short capture pass (A1, A2, A5 answers + goals from Dimension 1) to draft Sections 1–3 now
- Section 4 (Surfaces & Deliverables) is always populated from A5
- State which approach is taken in the closing summary

### Step 5: Solution Generation and Design Hand-off

**Recommended pipeline execution sequence:**

1. If product-discovery ran: extract theme tokens from `docs/product/ui-design-brief.md`
2. Run [`css-theme-generator`](../css-theme-generator/SKILL.md) (or `blazor-` / `xaml-theme-generator`), passing the accent colour
3. Run **designer** to refine component usage and design-system (Dimension 9)
4. Run **ui-developer** and **maui-apple-design** for platform-specific surfaces
5. Run [`solution-generator`](../solution-generator/SKILL.md) — pass architecture document and Product Specification as input
6. Translate each user story to [`vertical-slices`](../vertical-slices/SKILL.md) blueprint JSON (feature-by-feature)
7. Run [`playwright-tester`](../playwright-tester/SKILL.md) — consume the prototype as UI acceptance baseline
8. Run [`gap-review`](../gap-review/SKILL.md) — mandatory after generation; validates against design decisions and prototype fidelity

**Key deliverables consumed:**
- `docs/product/product-specification.md` — overall product scope and technical requirements (Deliverable 4)
- `docs/architecture/{SolutionName}-architecture.md` — architecture decisions and ADRs
- `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`, use-cases.md, user-stories.md — domain model and acceptance criteria
- Dimension 9 (Client Surfaces) + A5 — render mode, shared UI, design system — input to theme generators
- Prototype — visual-regression baseline, component mapping reference, design review gate

---

**My recommendation:** Start with email and in-app. SMS adds third-party costs and
compliance complexity (GDPR/TCPA). Push requires device registration infrastructure.
Both can be added in v2 once the channel abstraction is validated.

After the user answers, follow the dependency tree. If the user says
"email and in-app", the next question targets the email provider decision — not
an unrelated topic.
